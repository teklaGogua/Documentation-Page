          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p> Tao-Klarjeti (Georgian: ტაო-კლარჯეთი) is a Georgian historical and cultural region in north-eastern Turkey and south-western Georgia. The region is based around two river basins - Chorokhi and Kura (Mtkvari), and also partially includes the upper source of the Aras river. In modern usage it most often denotes the territory that was administrated or claimed by Georgian Democratic Republic but is nowadays part of Turkey due to the Soviet-Turkish deal in 1921.</p>
          <p>The term "Tao-Klarjeti" is based on the names of two most important provinces of the region — Tao and Klarjeti. The term is equivalent to “Zemo Kartli” (i.e., Upper Kartli or Upper Iberia) and is also a synonym for historical Meskheti.</p>

          <h1>Cultural and historical heritage</h1>
          <p>In the 9th century, under the auspices of the Georgian Bagratids, Tao-Klarjeti saw a revival of monastic life. Georgians, who made up the majority of the population north of Tao, were gradually moving south. Igor Dorfman-Lazarev notes that they discovered a number of monasteries abandoned by Armenians in the 8th century and reconstructed them; many new houses were built. Stephen H. Rapp notes that in this “new Kartli”, the Kartvelian migrants encountered the large Armenian population already living there. A cultural exchange took place between the two peoples.</p>  
          <p>Many important Georgian cultural monuments from the middle ages are located on the territory of Tao-Klarjeti and many of them are preserved as ruins. Several monuments of medieval Georgian architecture – abandoned or converted churches, monasteries, bridges and castles – are scattered across the area.</p>
          <p>Best known are the monasteries of Khandzta, Khakhuli, Ancha, the churches of Oshki, Ishkhani, Bana, Parkhali, Doliskana, Otkhta Eklesia, Opiza, Parekhi and Tbeti.</p>

          <h1>Khandzta</h1>
          <p>Khandzta (Georgian: ხანძთა, Georgian pronunciation: [χɑnd͡ztʰɑ]) was a medieval Georgian monastery founded by Gregory of Khandzta in 782 AD.</p>
          <p>In 780 the future St Gregory of Khandzta moved to Tao-Klarjeti to revive Georgian monasticism in the region. He initially resided at the monastery of Opiza but then founded his own monastery at Khandzta in c782, and soon it became the center of monastic life in Tao-Klarjeti under his direction. Its influence lasted after his death in 861. In the 10th century, a local monk, Giorgi Merchule, wrote a Life of Gregory, celebrated as a masterpiece of Georgian medieval hagiography.</p>

          <p>The first church at Khandzta was built of wood by Gregory and his companions. A dining hall and living cells were also built at that time (end of the 8th century). In 820, during the reign of Ashot I, a stone church was built to replace it by the nobleman Gabriel Dapanchuli. The present church building seems to be a replacement again, dating from 918. The remoteness of the site made the construction difficult, as most material, notably the high-quality sandstone, was not available locally and had to be hauled for long distances. The building was completed in 941.</p> 
          <p>A freestanding bell-tower was added in the 16th century. There is also a medieval chapel whose east wall acts as a fountain. From that time, the integration of the region into the Ottoman Empire and the progressive Islamisation of the population led to the decline of the monastery, and its eventual abandonment.</p>
          <p>The main church in the complex was built on the eastern part of an artificial terrace. Despite significant damage, its main structure has survived until now. An important part of the facade has been destroyed. Most of the cupola of the church collapsed in 2007.</p>

          <h1>Khakhuli Monastery</h1>
          <p>Khakhuli Monastery (Georgian: ხახულის მონასტერი, Turkish: Haho/Bağbaşi) was a Georgian Orthodox monastery in historical Medieval Georgian Kingdom of Tao (modern-day Turkey), in one of the gorges of the Tortum river. The main church is now used as a mosque.</p>
          <p>Khakhuli was a very important centre of literature and Georgian culture and many Georgian scholars and theologians studied and worked in Khakhuli including Basil of Khakhuli, Ioane Khakhuleli, Davit Tbileli, and Giorgi Mtatsmindeli.</p>
          <p>Khakhuli Monastery was founded in the second half of the 10th century by King David III Kurapalates and later the community advanced into an economically advanced region including 300 villages and 30 independent minor feudal lords. In the 16th century, prior to the Ottoman conquest of southern Georgian territories, Khakhuli was part of Kartli Catholicate and after the Ottoman conquest of Tao, Khakhuli got isolated from Georgia.</p>

         <section class="main-section" id="Ancha_monastery">
            <h1>Ancha monastery</h1>
            <p>Ancha (Georgian: ანჩის მონასტერი, anchis monasteri) was a medieval Georgian monastery and cathedral church of the Bishopric of Ancha, located near what is now the village of Anaçlı, Artvin Province, Turkey. Purportedly once a cross-in-square design, the church now lies almost completely in ruins.</p>
            <p>The earliest recorded information about the monastery of Ancha is found in c. 951 Vitae of Gregory of Khandzta by Giorgi Merchule, which dates the church roughly to the early 9th century. It functioned as one of the principal religious and cultural centers of the principality of Klarjeti, which was wrested of the Georgian control by the Ottoman Empire in the 1550s. By the middle of the 17th century, the church had been completely abandoned. Its surviving Christian relics, such as the venerated icon of the Savior, were transferred to the Georgian capital of Tbilisi. Shortly after the Russian takeover of the Artvin province, the historical Georgian churches and monasteries of the area were visited, in 1879, by the Georgian scholar Dimitri Bakradze, who reported severe damage to Ancha. In 1904, Nicholas Marr reported that only a portion of the monastery’s north-western and northern walls and an altar apse with a fragment of the cupola had been survived. Nowadays, the building is almost completely ruined.</p>

         <section class="main-section" id="Oshki">
            <h1>Oshki</h1>
            <p>Oshki(Georgian: ოშკი Oshki, Turkish: Oşkvank Manastırı/Çamlıyamaç) is a Georgian monastery from the second half of 
            the 10th century located in the historic province of Tao, now part of the territory of Turkey. Located in the historic province of Tao 
            (modern north-eastern Turkey). The main church, dedicated to St John the Baptist, was built between 963 and 973. The Monasterys location 
            in Turkey is in the village of Çamlıyamaç, in northeastern Erzurum Province, bordering Artvin Province. Oshki monastery was a major centre 
            of Georgian literature and enlightenment during the Middle Ages. The monastery is considered as 
            “one of the largest and architecturally most complex buildings produced anywhere in the Eastern Christian world”.</p>
          <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Oshki1.jpg" alt="Oshki">
          <li>Architectural sculpture and figurative reliefs</li>
          <p>The construction of the monastery at Osk/Oshki was sponsored by the Grand duke/King Bagrat II of Tao and David III of Tao.
          The blind arches are an important part of the whole decoration. In Oshki they stretch along the outer walls of the church in the south, east and north. It is an early example of the use of decorative blind arches on the facades. They divide the wall in line with the general architectural rhythm. The central part of the facade is mainly decorated with bas-reliefs.
          Bas-reliefs, placed high above the central arch, are given the place of honour on the southern facade, which is the main facade of the church. They stand out from the flat surface. The eagle with an animal in his talons probably symbolises victory, and the whole sculptural composition the triumph of the heavenly forces represented by the archangels Michael and Gabriel.
          In the province of Tao the power lay in the hands of the ruling dynasty of the Bagrationi, whose members Bagrat eristavt-eristavi and David Magistros are depicted lower down on the same facade, near the deesis, to show that the heavenly forces were the family's patrons. The figures are well proportioned, elegant in contour and form. The static postures of earlier donor portraits give way to free movement, and an equal attempt can be traced in the near three-dimensional renderings of the archangels and the deesis of the southern facade, as well as on a column in the southern gallery. The decorative system of the Oshki church also includes the low reliefs characteristic of the so-called transitional period in medieval Georgian art (8th - 10th centuries), when the old style had not yet given way completely, and new ways were evolving. Sculptors of the different generations must have worked on it. The church in Oshki already shows the tendencies that would eventually develop in the 11th century.</p>
          <li>Name and Etymology</li>
          <p>There are two different views regarding the etymology of the place name ოშკი (ošḳi; IPA: ɔʃkʼi): according to Kakha Shengelia and Valeri Silogava the word ოშკი (ošḳi) derives from Megrelian word შქა (shka), meaning "being in the middle";[15] according to Merab Chukhua, is Laz word and means "dog rose" (rosa canina), which corresponds to Georgian ასკილი (asḳili) and Kartvelian *ასკილ- (*asḳil-).[16] In Armenian and Turkish languages this monastery is named "Oshk vank" (from Armenian language "vank" - "cathedral").</p>

         <section class="main-section" id="Ishkhani">
          <h1>Ishkhani</h1>
          <p>Ishkani or Ishkhan, (Armenian: Իշխան, prince, Georgian: იშხანი, Turkish: Işhan) is a ruined Christian monastery in the territory of Turkey in the village of Arpacık, Artvin province. The name Ishkhani derives from the word “Իշխան” (Ishkhan) which means “prince” in the Armenian language. It was one of the important spiritual centers in the Middle Ages Tayk/Tao-Klarjeti. Only the magnificent church and the adjacent chapel have survived. The earliest mention of the monastery is found in The Life of Grigol Khandzteli, a Georgian manuscript dating from the year 951, which is now kept in Jerusalem.
      In this manuscript it is stated that Saba, the nephew and follower of the priest Gregory of Khandzta, founded a monastery on the site of an earlier church. The first church built by catholicos Nerses III (641-661), who was native from the village of Ishkhan, and is also known as Nerses III Ishkhanetsi, had a tetraconch plan (a central dome with four apses radiating to the cardinal points) and was presumably damaged during the Arab invasions of the 7th century. Five Georgian inscriptions within the church and on the southern facade indicate different restoration periods, from 917 until 1032. From the 12th to the end of the 14th century, large vestibules were added to the south, west and north facades. The monastery used to be one of the five patriarchates of Tao-Klarjeti and its church functioned as a cathedral until the 17th century. It was used as the headquarters for the Ottoman officers during the Russo-Turkish War in the 19th century, while its west arm was converted into a mosque and remained so until 1983. In 1987, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey) registered İshkhhan as a national cultural monument and the site is now protected. In 2013, the Monastery was being renovated, but work stopped because Georgia said the work was done improperly.</p>

         <section class="main-section" id="Bana_cathedral">
            <h1>Bana cathedral</h1>
          <p>Bana (Georgian: ბანა; Armenian: Բանակ Banak), also known by the modern Turkish designation Penek Kilisesi, is a ruined early medieval 
          cathedral in present-day Erzurum Province, eastern Turkey, in what had formerly been a historical marchland known to Armenians as Tayk and to Georgians as Tao.
          It is a large tetraconch design, surrounded by a near-rotunda polygonal ambulatory and marked with a cylindrical drum. Generally believed to have been constructed 
          in the 7th century, based on an 11th-century chronicle it was reconstructed by Adarnase IV of Iberia at some point between 881 and 923. Henceforth, it was used as a royal 
          cathedral by the Bagrationi dynasty until the Ottoman conquest of the area in the 16th century. The former cathedral was converted into a fortress by the Ottoman army during the Crimean War. 
          The monastery was almost completely ruined during the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-78.</p>
         <p>The dating of the Bana cathedral is a subject of scholarly debate. The Bana cathedral is mentioned in the 11th-century chronicle of Sumbat, who reports that the Georgian prince Adarnase IV (r. 881-923) ordered the building of the church of Bana "by the hand" of Kwirike, who subsequently became the first bishop of Bana. While the scholars such as Ekvtime Taqaishvili, Shalva Amiranashvili, and Stepan Mnatsakanian tend to interpret the passage literally, Chubinashvili, Vakhtang Beridze and Tiran Marutyan identify Adarnase as a renovator, not a builder of the church. This view, now shared by some art scholars, dates the Bana church – clearly modeled on the contemporaneous Zvartnots cathedral near Yerevan – to the mid-7th century. It was when the Chalcedonian-Armenian catholicos Nerses III, who presided over several important religious projects Zvartnots included, resided in exile in Tayk c. 653-58.</p>

         <p>A hypothetical reconstruction of Bana by the Russian architect Anatoly Kalgin, 1907
      Devastated during the 8th century by the Byzantine–Arab war, the region of Tao was gradually resettled by its new masters, the Georgian Bagratids, and under their patronage a monastic revival took place. With the settlements gradually expanding from the predominantly Georgian-populated north to the predominantly Armenian populated south and south-west, the Georgian princes reconstructed a number of monasteries abandoned by Armenians and built new foundations.
      The arched outer wall of the ambulatory. The sole surviving aisle column with its carved capital
      From the time of Adarnase IV's reconstruction, the cathedral of Bana was one of the principal royal churches of the Bagrationi dynasty.It was used for the coronation of Bagrat IV in 1027 and his marriage to Helena, a niece of the Byzantine emperor Romanos III Argyros in 1032. In the 15th century, King Vakhtang IV of Georgia (r. 1442-1446) and his consort khatun were buried at Bana. It was also the seat of the Georgian Orthodox bishop of Bana, whose diocese also included the neighboring areas of Taos-Kari, Panaskerti, and Oltisi.With the Ottoman conquest of the area in the 16th century, Bana was abandoned by Christians. During the Crimean War (1853–1865), the Ottoman military converted the church into a fortress, adding the crude bulwark still visible on the south side. During the Russo-Turkish war of 1877-78, it was shelled by the Russian artillery, blasting the dome off and inflicting severe damage on the 
      edifice. Later the Russians carted off much of masonry to build a late 19th-century church in Oltu.</p>
      <p>The church was first described and sketched by the German botanist Karl Koch in 1843. He declared it the most remarkable church in the East after the Hagia Sophia. Koch was followed by the Russian ethnographer Yevgeny Veidenbaum in 1879 and the Georgian historian Dimitri Bakradze in 1881. The latter two found the church already without a dome, but reported about still surviving frescos and a Georgian inscription in the Asomtavruli script. From 1902 to 1907, the ruins of Bana were scrupulously studied by an expedition led by the Georgian archaeologist Ekvtime Taqaishvili. Inaccessible to Soviet nationals, the monument was a subject of study of some Western scholars during the Cold War era. In 1983 the American archaeologist and art historian, Dr. Robert W. Edwards, completed a scientific assessment of the complex as well as an accurate plan drawn to scale.</p>
